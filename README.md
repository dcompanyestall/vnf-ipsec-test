# Site-to-site VPN Gateway

This container image provides a container to connect two peers
via IPsec to each other.

The current implementation uses StrongSwan but the idea is to
have the implementation details abstracted away.

This configuration should also be sufficient for every scenario where the public-ip is hidden on the virtual machine, so not visible by the `ip` command.

Testing though was just fulfiled on AWS.

Currently `--privileged` mode is a requirement, as this container will
try load missing kernel modules. Unless you can make sure all
required kernel modules are available, you also need to mount your
hosts `/lib/modules` into the container.

For other architectures, the code might have to be changed.

### Run this container

To run the container execute the following section:

```
# docker run --privileged \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
    --env-file environment.sh \
    openvnf/vnf-ipsec
```

### Configuration

Configuration is done by environment variables. See below for available options.
Alternatively it is also possible to point $ENVFILE to an environment file which is sourced before startup.

```sh
# source specified file before startup.
ENVFILE=

# set route for tunnel into the default routing table outside of the scope of strongswan
# use this just in conjunction with calico and host networking
SET_ROUTE_DEFAULT_TABLE=FALSE

# local IP of the node the container is supposed to be running on
# this IP has to able to be bound by the service and could also be '%any'
IPSEC_LOCALIP=

# The local identifier to be used during the handshake.
# This can either be an IP address, a FQDN, an email address or a distinguished
# name. This value has to be the same as IPSEC_REMOTEID on the other side of
# the tunnel.
IPSEC_LOCALID=

# local network to be shared over the VPN tunnel
# used for leftid=
IPSEC_LOCALNET=

# public IP address of the remote node of the tunnel
IPSEC_REMOTEIP=

# remote network to be shared
IPSEC_REMOTENET=

# the remote identifier for the connection
IPSEC_REMOTEID=

# pre shared key to be used for the tunnel
# this should be a long random string
IPSEC_PSK=

# method of key exchange
# ike | ikev1 | ikev2
IPSEC_KEYEXCHANGE=

# comma-separated list of ESP encryption/authentication algorithms to be used for the connection
# see https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/IKEv1CipherSuites
# or https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/IKEv2CipherSuites
# depending on your value for IPSEC_KEYEXCHANGE.
# example: esp=aes192gcm16-aes128gcm16-ecp256,aes192-sha256-modp3072
IPSEC_ESPCIPHER=

# comma-separated list of IKE/ISAKMP SA encryption/authentication algorithms to be used
# see https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/IKEv1CipherSuites
# or https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/IKEv2CipherSuites
# depending on your value for IPSEC_KEYEXCHANGE.
# example: aes192gcm16-aes128gcm16-prfsha256-ecp256-ecp521,aes192-sha256-modp3072
IPSEC_IKECIPHER=

# Force UDP encapsulation for ESP packets even if no NAT situation is detected.
# *yes* | no
IPSEC_FORCEUDP=


# uncomment the debug flag for additional debugging output
# DEBUG=yes
```

If usage of keys and certificates instead of pre shared keys should be used, the code of the repo has to be extended.

### VTI Interface

Related environment variables:
* IPSEC_LOCALIP
* IPSEC_VTI_KEY
* IPSEC_VTI_STATICROUTES

If the entrypoint is provided the argument `init`, an initialisation-container is started that can create a VTI tunnel to route
the IPSEC traffic over.

To create a VTI interface, set the environment variable `IPSEC_VTI_KEY` to an integer.

A VTI tunnel interface is then created with `IPSEC_LOCALIP` as local endpoint and `IPSEC_VTI_KEY` as key.

The parameter `IPSEC_VTI_KEY` must then be the same when starting the container in default mode to set the value as mark in the
IPSec connection configuration.

All comma-separated values of `IPSEC_VTI_STATICROUTES` are added as static routes via the created VTI tunnel.
